import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import { FlagsList } from './components/FlagsList/FlagsList';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

Install package:

<InstallScript packages="mantine-flagpack" />

Then import styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import 'mantine-flagpack/styles.css';
```

## Usage

All flags images are based on [flagpack](https://flagpack.xyz/). Unlike [react-flagpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flagpack)
package `mantine-flagpack` provides tree shakable cjs and ems bundles (unused flags will not be included in the bundle).
Add components exported from the package also support [Mantine style props](https://mantine.dev/styles/style-props/).
Some flag components have huge size (up to 20kb) and it is not recommended to import all flags in your application
– import only flags that you need:

```tsx
// Bad – you will have huge bundle size
import * as Flags from 'mantine-flagpack';

// Good – unused flags are removed from the production bundle
import { ESFlag, RUFlag } from 'mantine-flagpack';
```

## All flags
